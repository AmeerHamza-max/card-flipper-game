# Memory Game - Programming Languages

A simple memory game that allows players to match cards representing different programming languages. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience with a card flip mechanic.

## Features

- Memory game with cards representing programming languages.
- Cards flip over when clicked and reset after a short delay if they do not match.
- The game ensures only two cards can be selected at a time.
- Cards are shuffled randomly at the beginning of each game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations (e.g., card flip effect).
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including card shuffling and matching.

## How to Play

1. The game begins with a set of shuffled cards showing programming language logos.
2. Click on two cards to flip them over and try to find a matching pair.
3. If the cards match, they stay flipped over; otherwise, they will flip back after a short delay.
4. Continue playing until all pairs are matched.
